# paintbucketpendulum
A small javascript project that emulates a spinning paint bucket on a pendulum that you can use to create art! Inspired by the real life art of Callen Schaub

Mess around with factors like the pull of gravity, how fast the bucket is spinning, and the number of colors being used.  To see this project in action, visit https://stacksofcode.com/nate/paintbucketpendulum
